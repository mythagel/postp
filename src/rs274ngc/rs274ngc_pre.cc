   /* rs274ngc.cc

   This rs274ngc.cc file contains the source code for (1) the kernel of
   several rs274ngc interpreters and (2) two of the four sets of interface
   functions declared in canon.hh:
   1. interface functions to call to tell the interpreter what to do.
   These all return a status value.
   2. interface functions to call to get information from the interpreter.

   Kernel functions call each other. A few kernel functions are called by
   interface functions.

   Interface function names all begin with "rs274ngc_".

   Error handling is by returning a status value of either a non-error
   code (RS274NGC_OK, RS274NGC_EXIT, etc.) or some specific error code
   from each function where there is a possibility of error.  If an error
   occurs, processing is always stopped, and control is passed back up
   through the function call hierarchy to an interface function; the
   error code is also passed back up. The stack of functions called is
   also recorded. The external program calling an interface function may
   then handle the error further as it sees fit.

   Since returned values are usually used as just described to handle the
   possibility of errors, an alternative method of passing calculated
   values is required. In general, if function A needs a value for
   variable V calculated by function B, this is handled by passing a
   pointer to V from A to B, and B calculates and sets V.

   There are a lot of functions named read_XXXX. All such functions read
   characters from a string using a counter. They all reset the counter
   to point at the character in the string following the last one used by
   the function. The counter is passed around from function to function
   by using pointers to it. The first character read by each of these
   functions is expected to be a member of some set of characters (often
   a specific character), and each function checks the first character.

   This version of the interpreter not saving input lines. A list of all
   lines will be needed in future versions to implement loops, and
   probably for other purposes.

   This version does not use any additional memory as it runs. No
   memory is allocated by the source code.

   This version does not suppress superfluous commands, such as a command
   to start the spindle when the spindle is already turning, or a command
   to turn on flood coolant, when flood coolant is already on.  When the
   interpreter is being used for direct control of the machining center,
   suppressing superfluous commands might confuse the user and could be
   dangerous, but when it is used to translate from one file to another,
   suppression can produce more concise output. Future versions might
   include an option for suppressing superfluous commands.

   /* Interpreter global arrays for g_codes and m_codes. The nth entry
   in each array is the modal group number corresponding to the nth
   code. Entries which are -1 represent illegal codes. Remember g_codes
   in this interpreter are multiplied by 10.

   The modal g groups and group numbers defined in [NCMS, pages 71 - 73]
   (see also [Fanuc, pages 43 - 45]) are used here, except the canned
   cycles (g80 - g89), which comprise modal g group 9 in [Fanuc], are
   treated here as being in the same modal group (group 1) with the
   straight moves and arcs (g0, g1, g2,g3).  [Fanuc, page 45] says only
   one g_code from any one group may appear on a line, and we are
   following that rule. The straight_probe move, g38.2, is in group 1; it
   is not defined in [NCMS].

   Some g_codes are non-modal (g4, g10, g28, g30, g53, g92, g92.1, g92.2,
   and g92.3 here - many more in [NCMS]). [Fanuc] and [NCMS] put all
   these in the same group 0, so we do also. Logically, there are two
   subgroups, those which require coordinate values (g10, g28, g30, and
   g92) and those which do not (g4, g53, g92.1, g92.2, and g92.3).
   The subgroups are identified by itemization when necessary.

   Those in group 0 which require coordinate values may not be on the
   same line as those in group 1 (except g80) because they would be
   competing for the coordinate values. Others in group 0 may be used on
   the same line as those in group 1.

   A total of 52 G-codes are implemented.

   The groups are:
   group  0 = {g4,g10,g28,g30,g53,g92,g92.1,g92.2,g92.3} - NON-MODAL
   dwell, setup, return to ref1, return to ref2,
   motion in machine coordinates, set and unset axis offsets
   group  1 = {g0,g1,g2,g3,g38.2,g80,g81,g82,g83,g84,g85,g86,g87,g88,g89} - motion
   group  2 = {g17,g18,g19}   - plane selection
   group  3 = {g90,g91}       - distance mode
   group  5 = {g93,g94}       - feed rate mode
   group  6 = {g20,g21}       - units
   group  7 = {g40,g41,g42}   - cutter diameter compensation
   group  8 = {g43,g49}       - tool length offset
   group 10 = {g98,g99}       - return mode in canned cycles
   group 12 = {g54,g55,g56,g57,g58,g59,g59.1,g59.2,g59.3} - coordinate system
   group 13 = {g61,g61.1,g64} - control mode

   Returned Value: int
   If any of the following errors occur, this returns the error code shown.
   Otherwise, it returns RS274NGC_OK.
   1. A left parenthesis is found inside a comment:
   NCE_NESTED_COMMENT_FOUND
   2. The line ends before an open comment is closed:
   NCE_UNCLOSED_COMMENT_FOUND
   3. A newline character is found that is not followed by null:
   NCE_NULL_MISSING_AFTER_NEWLINE

   Side effects: See below

   Called by:  read_text

   To simplify handling upper case letters, spaces, and tabs, this
   function removes spaces and and tabs and downcases everything on a
   line which is not part of a comment.

   Comments are left unchanged in place. Comments are anything
   enclosed in parentheses. Nested comments, indicated by a left
   parenthesis inside a comment, are illegal.

   The line must have a null character at the end when it comes in.
   The line may have one newline character just before the end. If
   there is a newline, it will be removed.

   Although this software system detects and rejects all illegal characters
   and illegal syntax, this particular function does not detect problems
   with anything but comments.

   We are treating RS274 code here as case-insensitive and spaces and
   tabs as if they have no meaning. [RS274D, page 6] says spaces and tabs
   are to be ignored by control.

   The KT and NGC manuals say nothing about case or spaces and tabs.

   Returned Value: int
   If one of the following functions returns an error code,
   this returns that error code.
   convert_arc_comp1
   convert_arc_comp2
   convert_arc2
   If any of the following errors occur, this returns the error code shown.
   Otherwise, this returns RS274NGC_OK.
   1. The block has neither an r value nor any i,j,k values:
   NCE_R_I_J_K_WORDS_ALL_MISSING_FOR_ARC
   2. The block has both an r value and one or more i,j,k values:
   NCE_MIXED_RADIUS_IJK_FORMAT_FOR_ARC
   3. In the ijk format the XY-plane is selected and
   the block has a k value: NCE_K_WORD_GIVEN_FOR_ARC_IN_XY_PLANE
   4. In the ijk format the YZ-plane is selected and
   the block has an i value: NCE_I_WORD_GIVEN_FOR_ARC_IN_YZ_PLANE
   5. In the ijk format the XZ-plane is selected and
   the block has a j value: NCE_J_WORD_GIVEN_FOR_ARC_IN_XZ_PLANE
   6. In either format any of the following occurs.
   a. The XY-plane is selected and the block has no x or y value:
   NCE_X_AND_Y_WORDS_MISSING_FOR_ARC_IN_XY_PLANE
   b. The YZ-plane is selected and the block has no y or z value:
   NCE_Y_AND_Z_WORDS_MISSING_FOR_ARC_IN_YZ_PLANE
   c. The ZX-plane is selected and the block has no z or x value:
   NCE_X_AND_Z_WORDS_MISSING_FOR_ARC_IN_XZ_PLANE
   7. The selected plane is an unknown plane:
   NCE_BUG_PLANE_NOT_XY_YZ__OR_XZ
   8. The feed rate mode is UNITS_PER_MINUTE and feed rate is zero:
   NCE_CANNOT_MAKE_ARC_WITH_ZERO_FEED_RATE
   9. The feed rate mode is INVERSE_TIME and the block has no f word:
   NCE_F_WORD_MISSING_WITH_INVERSE_TIME_ARC_MOVE

   Side effects:
   This generates and executes an arc command at feed rate
   (and, possibly a second arc command). It also updates the setting
   of the position of the tool point to the end point of the move.

   Called by: convert_motion.

   This converts a helical or circular arc.  The function calls:
   convert_arc2 (when cutter radius compensation is off) or
   convert_arc_comp1 (when cutter comp is on and this is the first move) or
   convert_arc_comp2 (when cutter comp is on and this is not the first move).

   If the ijk format is used, at least one of the offsets in the current
   plane must be given in the block; it is common but not required to
   give both offsets. The offsets are always incremental [NCMS, page 21].

   /* convert_axis_offsets

   Returned Value: int
   If any of the following errors occur, this returns the error code shown.
   Otherwise, it returns RS274NGC_OK.
   1. The function is called when cutter radius compensation is on:
   NCE_CANNOT_CHANGE_AXIS_OFFSETS_WITH_CUTTER_RADIUS_COMP
   2. The g_code argument is not G_92, G_92_1, G_92_2, or G_92_3
   NCE_BUG_CODE_NOT_IN_G92_SERIES

   Side effects:
   SET_PROGRAM_ORIGIN is called, and the coordinate
   values for the axis offsets are reset. The coordinates of the
   current point are reset. Parameters may be set.

   Called by: convert_modal_0.

   The action of G92 is described in [NCMS, pages 10 - 11] and {Fanuc,
   pages 61 - 63]. [NCMS] is ambiguous about the intent, but [Fanuc]
   is clear. When G92 is executed, an offset of the origin is calculated
   so that the coordinates of the current point with respect to the moved
   origin are as specified on the line containing the G92. If an axis
   is not mentioned on the line, the coordinates of the current point
   are not changed. The execution of G92 results in an axis offset being
   calculated and saved for each of the six axes, and the axis offsets
   are always used when motion is specified with respect to absolute
   distance mode using any of the nine coordinate systems (those designated
   by G54 - G59.3). Thus all nine coordinate systems are affected by G92.

   Being in incremental distance mode has no effect on the action of G92
   in this implementation. [NCMS] is not explicit about this, but it is
   implicit in the second sentence of [Fanuc, page 61].

   The offset is the amount the origin must be moved so that the
   coordinate of the controlled point has the specified value. For
   example, if the current point is at X=4 in the currently specified
   coordinate system and the current X-axis offset is zero, then "G92 x7"
   causes the X-axis offset to be reset to -3.

   Since a non-zero offset may be already be in effect when the G92 is
   called, that must be taken into account.

   In addition to causing the axis offset values in the _setup model to be
   set, G92 sets parameters 5211 to 5216 to the x,y,z,a,b,c axis offsets.

   The action of G92.2 is described in [NCMS, page 12]. There is no
   equivalent command in [Fanuc]. G92.2 resets axis offsets to zero.
   G92.1, also included in [NCMS, page 12] (but the usage here differs
   slightly from the spec), is like G92.2, except that it also causes
   the axis offset parameters to be set to zero, whereas G92.2 does not
   zero out the parameters.

   G92.3 is not in [NCMS]. It sets the axis offset values to the values
   given in the parameters.

   COORDINATE SYSTEMS (involves g10, g53, g54 - g59.3, g92)

   The canonical machining functions view of coordinate systems is:
   1. There are two coordinate systems: absolute and program.
   2. All coordinate values are given in terms of the program coordinate system.
   3. The offsets of the program coordinate system may be reset.

   The RS274/NGC view of coordinate systems, as given in section 3.2
   of [NCMS] is:
   1. there are ten coordinate systems: absolute and 9 program. The
   program coordinate systems are numbered 1 to 9.
   2. you can switch among the 9 but not to the absolute one. G54
   selects coordinate system 1, G55 selects 2, and so on through
   G56, G57, G58, G59, G59.1, G59.2, and G59.3.
   3. you can set the offsets of the 9 program coordinate systems
   using G10 L2 Pn (n is the number of the coordinate system) with
   values for the axes in terms of the absolute coordinate system.
   4. the first one of the 9 program coordinate systems is the default.
   5. data for coordinate systems is stored in parameters [NCMS, pages 59 - 60].
   6. g53 means to interpret coordinate values in terms of the absolute
   coordinate system for the one block in which g53 appears.
   7. You can offset the current coordinate system using g92. This offset
   will then apply to all nine program coordinate systems.

   The approach used in the interpreter mates the canonical and NGC views
   of coordinate systems as follows:

   During initialization, data from the parameters for the first NGC
   coordinate system is used in a offset_origin function call and
   origin_index in the machine model is set to 1.

   If a g_code in the range g54 - g59.3 is encountered in an NC program,
   the data from the appropriate NGC coordinate system is copied into the
   origin offsets used by the interpreter, a offset_origin function
   call is made, and the current position is reset.

   If a g10 is encountered, the convert_setup function is called to reset
   the offsets of the program coordinate system indicated by the P number
   given in the same block.

   If a g53 is encountered, the axis values given in that block are used
   to calculate what the coordinates are of that point in the current
   coordinate system, and a rapid or linear function
   call to that point using the calculated values is made. No offset
   values are changed.

   If a g92 is encountered, that is handled by the convert_axis_offsets
   function. A g92 results in an axis offset for each axis being calculated
   and stored in the machine model. The axis offsets are applied to all
   nine coordinate systems. Axis offsets are initialized to zero.

   1. The selected plane is not the XY plane:

   NCE_CANNOT_TURN_CUTTER_RADIUS_COMP_ON_WHEN_ON

   Side effects:
   A COMMENT function call is made (conditionally) saying that the
   interpreter is switching mode so that cutter radius compensation is on.
   The value of cutter_comp_radius in the machine model mode is
   set to the absolute value of the radius given in the tool table.
   The value of cutter_comp_side in the machine model mode is
   set to RIGHT or LEFT. The currently active tool table index in
   the machine model is updated.

   Called by: convert_cutter_compensation

   check_other_codes checks that a d word occurs only in a block with g41
   or g42.

   Cutter radius compensation is carried out in the interpreter, so no
   call is made to a canonical function (although there is a canonical
   function, START_CUTTER_RADIUS_COMPENSATION, that could be called if
   the primitive level could execute it).

   This version uses a D word if there is one in the block, but it does
   not require a D word, since the sample programs which the interpreter
   is supposed to handle do not have them.  Logically, the D word is
   optional, since the D word is always (except in cases we have never
   heard of) the slot number of the tool in the spindle. Not requiring a
   D word is contrary to [Fanuc, page 116] and [NCMS, page 79], however.
   Both manuals require the use of the D-word with G41 and G42.

   This version handles a negative offset radius, which may be
   encountered if the programmed tool path is a center line path for
   cutting a profile and the path was constructed using a nominal tool
   diameter. Then the value in the tool table for the diameter is set to
   be the difference between the actual diameter and the nominal
   diameter. If the actual diameter is less than the nominal, the value
   in the table is negative. The method of handling a negative radius is
   to switch the side of the offset and use a positive radius. This
   requires that the profile use arcs (not straight lines) to go around
   convex corners.

   A number of moves are made as described below. This cycle is a
   modified version of [Monarch, page 5-24] since [NCMS, pages 98 - 100]
   gives no clue as to what the cycle is supposed to do. [KT] does not
   have a back boring cycle. [Fanuc, page 132] in "Canned cycle II"
   describes the G87 cycle as given here, except that the direction of
   spindle turning is always clockwise and step 7 below is omitted
   in [Fanuc].

   For the XY plane, this implements the following RS274/NGC cycle, which
   is usually back boring.  The situation is that you have a through hole
   and you want to counterbore the bottom of hole. To do this you put an
   L-shaped tool in the spindle with a cutting surface on the UPPER side
   of its base. You stick it carefully through the hole when it is not
   spinning and is oriented so it fits through the hole, then you move it
   so the stem of the L is on the axis of the hole, start the spindle,
   and feed the tool upward to make the counterbore. Then you get the
   tool out of the hole.

   1. Move at traverse rate parallel to the XY-plane to the point
   with x-value offset_x and y-value offset_y.
   2. Stop the spindle in a specific orientation.
   3. Move the z-axis only at traverse rate downward to the bottom_z.
   4. Move at traverse rate parallel to the XY-plane to the x,y location.
   5. Start the spindle in the direction it was going before.
   6. Move the z-axis only at the given feed rate upward to the middle_z.
   7. Move the z-axis only at the given feed rate back down to bottom_z.
   8. Stop the spindle in the same orientation as before.
   9. Move at traverse rate parallel to the XY-plane to the point
   with x-value offset_x and y-value offset_y.
   10. Move the z-axis only at traverse rate to the clear z value.
   11. Move at traverse rate parallel to the XY-plane to the specified x,y
   location.
   12. Restart the spindle in the direction it was going before.

   CYCLE_MACRO has positioned the tool at (x, y, r, a, b, c) before this starts.

   It might be useful to add a check that clear_z > middle_z > bottom_z.
   Without the check, however, this can be used to counterbore a hole in
   material that can only be accessed through a hole in material above it.

   For the XZ and YZ planes, this makes analogous motions.

   Side effects:
   A number of moves are made to execute the g-code

   Called by: convert_cycle

   The function does not require that any of x,y,z, or r be specified in
   the block, except that if the last motion mode command executed was
   not the same as this one, the r-value and z-value must be specified.

   This function is handling the repeat feature of RS274/NGC, wherein
   the L word represents the number of repeats [NCMS, page 99]. We are
   not allowing L=0, contrary to the manual. We are allowing L > 1
   in absolute distance mode to mean "do the same thing in the same
   place several times", as provided in the manual, although this seems
   abnormal.

   In incremental distance mode, x, y, and r values are treated as
   increments to the current position and z as an increment from r.  In
   absolute distance mode, x, y, r, and z are absolute. In g87, i and j
   will always be increments, regardless of the distance mode setting, as
   implied in [NCMS, page 98], but k (z-value of top of counterbore) will
   be an absolute z-value in absolute distance mode, and an increment
   (from bottom z) in incremental distance mode.

   If the r position of a cycle is above the current_z position, this
   retracts the z-axis to the r position before moving parallel to the
   XY plane.

   In the code for this function, there is a nearly identical "for" loop
   in every case of the switch. The loop is the done with a compiler
   macro, "CYCLE_MACRO" so that the code is easy to read, automatically
   kept identical from case to case and, and much shorter than it would
   be without the macro. The loop could be put outside the switch, but
   then the switch would run every time around the loop, not just once,
   as it does here. The loop could also be placed in the called
   functions, but then it would not be clear that all the loops are the
   same, and it would be hard to keep them the same when the code is
   modified.  The macro would be very awkward as a regular function
   because it would have to be passed all of the arguments used by any of
   the specific cycles, and, if another switch in the function is to be
   avoided, it would have to passed a function pointer, but the different
   cycle functions have different arguments so the type of the pointer
   could not be declared unless the cycle functions were re-written to
   take the same arguments (in which case most of them would have several
   unused arguments).

   The motions within the CYCLE_MACRO (but outside a specific cycle) are
   a straight traverse parallel to the selected plane to the given
   position in the plane and a straight traverse of the third axis only
   (if needed) to the r position.

   The CYCLE_MACRO is defined here but is also used in convert_cycle_yz
   and convert_cycle_zx. The variables aa, bb, and cc are used in
   CYCLE_MACRO and in the other two functions just mentioned. Those
   variables represent the first axis of the selected plane, the second
   axis of the selected plane, and third axis which is perpendicular to
   the selected plane.  In this function aa represents x, bb represents
   y, and cc represents z. This usage makes it possible to have only one
   version of each of the cycle functions.  The cycle_traverse and
   cycle_feed functions help accomplish this.

   The height of the retract move at the end of each repeat of a cycle is
   determined by the setting of the retract_mode: either to the r
   position (if the retract_mode is R_PLANE) or to the original
   z-position (if that is above the r position and the retract_mode is
   not R_PLANE). This is a slight departure from [NCMS, page 98], which
   does not require checking that the original z-position is above r.

   The rotary axes may not move during a canned cycle.

   It is a little distracting that this function uses zx in some places

   order for a right-handed coordinate system. Also with that usage,
   permutation of the symbols x, y, and z would allow for automatically
   converting the convert_cycle_xy function (or convert_cycle_yz) into
   the convert_cycle_xz function. However, the canonical interface uses
   Plane::XZ.

   - coordinate system selection.
   7.  mode 13, one of (G61, G61.1, G64) - control mode
   8.  mode 3, one of (G90, G91) - distance mode.
   9.  mode 10, one of (G98, G99) - retract mode.

   setting coordinate system locations, return to reference point 1,
   return to reference point 2, setting or cancelling axis offsets.
   11. mode 1, one of (G0, G1, G2, G3, G38.2, G80, G81 to G89) - motion or cancel.
   G53 from mode 0 is also handled here, if present.

   We are not changing the parameters that represent the positions

   When an m2 or m30 (program_end) is encountered, this returns RS274NGC_EXIT.
   If the code is not m0, m1, m2, m30, or m60, this returns
   NCE_BUG_CODE_NOT_M0_M1_M2_M30_M60
   Otherwise, it returns RS274NGC_OK.

   Side effects:
   An m0, m1, m2, m30, or m60 in the block is executed.

   For m0, m1, and m60, this makes a function call to the program_stop
   canonical machining function (which stops program execution).
   In addition, m60 calls pallet_shuttle.

   For m2 and m30, this resets the machine and then calls program_end.
   In addition, m30 calls pallet_shuttle.

   Called by: execute_block.

   This handles stopping or ending the program (m0, m1, m2, m30, m60)

   [NCMS] specifies how the following modes should be reset at m2 or
   m30. The descriptions are not collected in one place, so this list
   may be incomplete.

   G52 offsetting coordinate zero points [NCMS, page 10]
   G92 coordinate offset using tool position [NCMS, page 10]

   The following should have reset values, but no description of reset
   behavior could be found in [NCMS].
   G17, G18, G19 selected plane [NCMS, pages 14, 20]
   G90, G91 distance mode [NCMS, page 15]
   G93, G94 feed mode [NCMS, pages 35 - 37]
   M48, M49 overrides enabled, disabled [NCMS, pages 37 - 38]
   M3, M4, M5 spindle turning [NCMS, page 7]

   The following should be set to some value at machine start-up but
   not automatically reset by any of the stopping codes.
   1. G20, G21 length units [NCMS, page 15]. This is up to the installer.
   2. motion_control_mode. This is set in rs274ngc_init but not reset here.
   Might add it here.

   The following resets have been added by calling the appropriate
   canonical machining command and/or by resetting interpreter
   settings. They occur on M2 or M30.

   1. Axis offsets are set to zero (like g92.2) and      - offset_origin
   origin offsets are set to the default (like G54)
   2. Selected plane is set to Plane::XY (like G17) - plane
   3. Distance mode is set to MODE_ABSOLUTE (like G90)   - no canonical call
   4. Feed mode is set to UNITS_PER_MINUTE (like G94)    - no canonical call
   5. Feed and speed overrides are set to ON (like M48)  - feed_override_enable
   - speed_override_enable
   6. Cutter compensation is turned off (like G40)       - no canonical call
   7. The spindle is stopped (like M5)                   - spindle_stop
   8. The motion mode is set to G_1 (like G1)            - no canonical call
   9. Coolant is turned off (like M9)                    - coolant_flood_off & coolant_mist_off

   5. A move is called with G53 and cutter radius compensation on:

   Side effects:
   This executes a linear command at cutting feed rate
   (if move is G_1) or a rapid command (if move is G_0).
   It also updates the setting of the position of the tool point to the
   end point of the move. If cutter radius compensation is on, it may
   also generate an arc before the straight move. Also, in INVERSE_TIME
   feed mode, feed_rate will be called the feed rate setting changed.

   Called by: convert_motion.

   The approach to operating in incremental distance mode (g91) is to
   put the the absolute position values into the block before using the
   block to generate a move.

   In inverse time feed mode, a lower bound of 0.1 is placed on the feed
   rate so that the feed rate is never set to zero. If the destination
   point is the same as the current point, the feed rate would be
   calculated as zero otherwise.

   NCE_CONCAVE_CORNER_WITH_CUTTER_RADIUS_COMP

   Side effects:
   This executes a linear command at cutting feed rate
   or a rapid command.
   It also generates an arc to go around a corner, if necessary.
   It also updates the setting of the position of the tool point to
   the end point of the move and updates the programmed point.
   If INVERSE_TIME feed mode is in effect, it also calls feed_rate
   and resets the feed rate in the machine model.

   Called by: convert_straight.

   This is called if cutter radius compensation is on and
   settings.program_x is not UNKNOWN, indicating that this is not the
   first move after cutter radius compensation is turned on.

   The algorithm used here is:
   1. Determine the direction of the last motion. This is done by finding
   the direction of the line from the last programmed point to the
   current tool tip location. This line is a radius of the tool and is
   perpendicular to the direction of motion since the cutter is tangent
   to that direction.
   2. Determine the direction of the programmed motion.
   3. If there is a convex corner, insert an arc to go around the corner.
   4. Find the destination point for the tool tip. The tool will be
   tangent to the line from the last programmed point to the present
   programmed point at the present programmed point.
   5. Go in a straight line from the current tool tip location to the
   destination tool tip location.

   This uses an angle tolerance of TOLERANCE_CONCAVE_CORNER (0.01 radian)
   to determine if:
   1) an illegal concave corner exists (tool will not fit into corner),
   2) no arc is required to go around the corner (i.e. the current line
   is in the same direction as the end of the previous move), or
   3) an arc is required to go around a convex corner and start off in
   a new direction.

   If a rotary axis is moved in this block and an extra arc is required
   to go around a sharp corner, all the rotary axis motion occurs on the
   arc.  An alternative might be to distribute the rotary axis motion
   over the arc and the straight move in proportion to their lengths.

   If the Z-axis is moved in this block and an extra arc is required to
   go around a sharp corner, all the Z-axis motion occurs on the straight
   line and none on the extra arc.  An alternative might be to distribute
   the Z-axis motion over the extra arc and the straight line in
   proportion to their lengths.

   This handles inverse time feed rates by computing the length of the
   compensated path.

   This handles the case of there being no XY motion.

   This handles G0 moves. Where an arc is inserted to round a corner in a
   G1 move, no arc is inserted for a G0 move; a rapid is made
   from the current point to the end point. The end point for a G0
   move is the same as the end point for a G1 move, however.

   /* convert_tool_change

   Returned Value: int (RS274NGC_OK)

   Side effects:
   This makes function calls to canonical machining functions, and sets
   the machine model as described below.

   Called by: convert_m

   This function carries out an m6 command, which changes the tool in the
   spindle. The only function call this makes is to the tool_change
   function. The semantics of this function call is that when it is
   completely carried out, the tool that was selected is in the spindle,
   the tool that was in the spindle (if any) is returned to its changer
   slot, the spindle will be stopped (but the spindle speed setting will
   not have changed) and the x, y, z, a, b, and c positions will be the same
   as they were before (although they may have moved around during the
   change).

   It would be nice to add more flexibility to this function by allowing
   more changes to occur (position changes, for example) as a result of
   the tool change. There are at least two ways of doing this:

   1. Require that certain machine settings always have a given fixed
   value after a tool change (which may be different from what the value
   was before the change), and record the fixed values somewhere (in the
   world model that is read at initialization, perhaps) so that this
   function can retrieve them and reset any settings that have changed.
   Fixed values could even be hard coded in this function.

   2. Allow the executor of the tool_change function to change the state
   of the world however it pleases, and have the interpreter read the
   executor's world model after the tool_change function is carried out.
   Implementing this would require a change in other parts of the EMC
   system, since calls to the interpreter would then have to be
   interleaved with execution of the function calls output by the
   interpreter.

   There may be other commands in the block that includes the tool change.
   They will be executed in the order described in execute_block.

   This implements the "Next tool in T word" approach to tool selection.
   The tool is selected when the T word is read (and the carousel may
   move at that time) but is changed when M6 is read.

   Note that if a different tool is put into the spindle, the current_z
   location setting may be incorrect for a time. It is assumed the
   program will contain an appropriate tool_length_offset command
   near the tool_change command, so that the incorrect setting is only
   temporary.

   In [NCMS, page 73, 74] there are three other legal approaches in addition
   to this one.

   This finds the coordinates of a point, "end", in the currently

   In all cases, if no value for the coodinate is given in the block, the

   compensation is on, this function is called before compensation
   calculations are performed, so the current value of the programmed
   point is used, not the current value of the actual current_point.

   There are three cases for when the coordinate is included in the block:

   1. G_53 is active. This means to interpret the coordinates as machine
   coordinates. That is accomplished by adding the two offsets to the
   coordinate given in the block.

   2. Absolute coordinate mode is in effect. The coordinate in the block
   is used.

   3. Incremental coordinate mode is in effect. The coordinate in the

   When this function is called, counter is pointing at an item on the

   function reads characters which tell how to set the g_code.

   The RS274/NGC manual [NCMS, page 51] allows g_codes to be represented
   by expressions and provide [NCMS, 71 - 73] that a g_code must evaluate
   to to a number of the form XX.X (59.1, for example). The manual does not
   say how close an expression must come to one of the allowed values for
   it to be legitimate. Is 59.099999 allowed to mean 59.1, for example?
   In the interpreter, we adopt the convention that the evaluated number
   for the g_code must be within 0.0001 of a value of the form XX.X

   To simplify the handling of g_codes, we convert them to integers by
   multiplying by 10 and rounding down or up if within 0.001 of an
   integer. Other functions that deal with g_codes handle them
   symbolically, however. The symbols are defined in rs274NGC.hh
   where G_1 is 10, G_83 is 830, etc.

   This allows any number of g_codes on one line, provided that no two
   are in the same modal group.

   If a reader function which is called returns an error code, that

   If any of the following errors occur, this returns the error code shown.
   Otherwise, it returns RS274NGC_OK.
   1. the first character read is not a known character for starting a
   word: NCE_BAD_CHARACTER_USED

   Side effects:
   This function reads one item from a line of RS274/NGC code and inserts
   the information in a block. System parameters may be reset.

   Called by: read_items.

   When this function is called, the counter is set so that the position
   being considered is the first position of a word. The character at
   that position must be one known to the system.  In this version those
   characters are: a,b,c,d,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,p,q,r,s,t,x,y,z,(,#.
   However, read_items calls read_line_number directly if the first word
   begins with n, so no read function is included in the "_readers" array
   for the letter n. Thus, if an n word is encountered in the middle of
   a line, this function reports NCE_BAD_CHARACTER_USED.

   The function looks for a letter or special character and calls a
   selected function according to what the letter or character is.  The
   selected function will be responsible to consider all the characters
   that comprise the remainder of the item, and reset the pointer so that
   it points to the next character after the end of the item (which may be
   the end of the line or the first character of another item).

   After an item is read, the counter is set at the index of the

   have prevented the system from getting this far, so that this function
   can assume a close parenthesis will be found when an open parenthesis
   has been found, and that comments are not nested.

   /* read_parameter_setting

   Returned Value: int
   If read_real_value or read_integer_value returns an error code,
   this returns that code.
   If any of the following errors occur, this returns the error code shown.
   Otherwise, it returns RS274NGC_OK.
   1. The first character read is not # :
   NCE_BUG_FUNCTION_SHOULD_NOT_HAVE_BEEN_CALLED
   2. The parameter index is out of range: PARAMETER_NUMBER_OUT_OF_RANGE
   3. An equal sign does not follow the parameter expression:
   NCE_EQUAL_SIGN_MISSING_IN_PARAMETER_SETTING

   Side effects:
   counter is reset to the character following the end of the parameter
   setting. The parameter whose index follows "#" is set to the
   real value following "=".

   Called by: read_one_item

   When this function is called, counter is pointing at an item on the
   line that starts with the character '#', indicating a parameter
   setting when found by read_one_item.  The function reads characters
   which tell how to set the parameter.

   Any number of parameters may be set on a line. If parameters set early
   on the line are used in expressions farther down the line, the
   parameters have their old values, not their new values. This is
   usually called setting parameters in parallel.

   Parameter setting is not clearly described in [NCMS, pp. 51 - 62]: it is
   not clear if more than one parameter setting per line is allowed (any
   number is OK in this implementation). The characters immediately following
   the "#" must constitute a "parameter expression", but it is not clear
   what that is. Here we allow any expression as long as it evaluates to
   an integer.

   Parameters are handled in the interpreter by having a parameter table
   and a parameter buffer as part of the machine settings. The parameter
   table is passed to the reading functions which need it. The parameter
   buffer is used directly by functions that need it. Reading functions
   may set parameter values in the parameter buffer. Reading functions
   may obtain parameter values; these come from parameter table.

   The parameter buffer has three parts: (i) a counter for how many
   parameters have been set while reading the current line (ii) an array
   of the indexes of parameters that have been set while reading the
   current line, and (iii) an array of the values for the parameters that
   have been set while reading the current line; the nth value
   corresponds to the nth index. Any given index will appear once in the
   index number array for each time the parameter with that index is set
   on a line. There is no point in setting the same parameter more than
   one on a line because only the last setting of that parameter will
   take effect.

   The syntax recognized by this this function is # followed by an
   integer expression (explicit integer or expression evaluating to an
   integer) followed by = followed by a real value (number or
   expression).

   Note that # also starts a bunch of characters which represent a parameter
   to be evaluated. That situation is handled by read_parameter.

   Segmenting Expressions -

   The RS274/NGC manual, section 3.5.1.1 [NCMS, page 50], provides for
   using square brackets to segment expressions.

   Binary Operations -

   The RS274/NGC manual, section 3.5.1.1, discusses expression evaluation.
   The manual provides for eight binary operations: the four basic
   mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication,
   division), three logical operations (non-exclusive OR, exclusive OR,
   and AND2) and the modulus operation. The manual does not explicitly call
   these "binary" operations, but implicitly recognizes that they are
   binary. We have added the "power" operation of raising the number
   on the left of the operation to the power on the right; this is
   needed for many basic machining calculations.

   There are two groups of binary operations given in the manual. If
   operations are strung together as shown in Example 1, operations in
   the first group are to be performed before operations in the second
   group. If an expression contains more than one operation from the same
   group (such as * and / in Example 1), the operation on the left is
   performed first. The first group is: multiplication (*), division (/),
   and modulus (MOD). The second group is: addition(+), subtraction (-),
   logical non-exclusive or (OR), logical exclusive or (XOR), and logical
   and (AND2). We have added a third group with higher precedence than
   the first group. The third group contains only the power (**)
   operation.

   The logical operations and modulus are apparently to be performed on
   any real numbers, not just on integers or on some other data type.

   Unary Operations -

   The RS274/NGC manual, section 3.5.1.2, provides for fifteen unary
   mathematical operations. Two of these, BIN and BCD, are apparently for
   converting between decimal and hexadecimal number representation,
   although the text is not clear. These have not been implemented, since
   we are not using any hexadecimal numbers. The other thirteen unary
   operations have been implemented: absolute_value, arc_cosine, arc_sine,
   arc_tangent, cosine, e_raised_to, fix_down, fix_up, natural_log_of,
   round, sine, square_root, tangent.

   The manual section 3.5.1.2 [NCMS, page 51] requires the argument to
   all unary operations (except atan) to be in square brackets.  Thus,
   for example "sin[90]" is allowed in the interpreter, but "sin 90" is
   not. The atan operation must be in the format "atan[..]/[..]".

   Production Rule Definitions in Terms of Tokens -

   The following is a production rule definition of what this RS274NGC
   interpreter recognizes as valid combinations of symbols which form a
   recognized real_value (the top of this production hierarchy).

   The notion of "integer_value" is used in the interpreter. Below it is
   defined as a synonym for real_value, but in fact a constraint is added
   which cannot be readily written in a production language.  An
   integer_value is a real_value which is very close to an integer.
   Integer_values are needed for array and table indices and (when
   divided by 10) for the values of M codes and G codes. All numbers
   (including integers) are read as real numbers and stored as doubles.
   If an integer_value is required in some situation, a test for being
   close to an integer is applied to the number after it is read.

   When this function is called, the counter should be set at a left
   bracket. The function reads up to and including the right bracket
   which closes the expression.

   The basic form of an expression is: [v1 bop v2 bop ... vn], where the
   vi are real_values and the bops are binary operations. The vi may be
   numbers, parameters, expressions, or unary functions. Because some
   bops are to be evaluated before others, for understanding the order of
   evaluation, it is useful to rewrite the general form collecting any
   subsequences of bops of the same precedence. For example, suppose the
   expression is: [9+8*7/6+5-4*3**2+1]. It may be rewritten as:
   [9+[8*7/6]+5-[4*[3**2]]+1] to show how it should be evaluated.

   The manual provides that operations of the same precedence should be
   processed left to right.

   The first version of this function is commented out. It is suitable
   for when there are only two precendence levels. It is an improvement
   over the version used in interpreters before 2000, but not as general
   as the second version given here.

   The first version of this function reads the first value and the first
   operation in the expression. Then it calls either read_rest_bop1 or
   read_rest_bop2 according to whether the first operation is a bop1 or a
   bop2.  Read_rest_bop1 resets the next_operation to either a right
   bracket or a bop2. If it is reset to a bop2, read_rest_bop2 is called
   when read_rest_bop1 returns.

   The counter is reset to point to the first character after the real.

   Called by:  read_real_value

   This attempts to read a number out of the line, starting at the index
   given by the counter. It stops when the first character that cannot
   be part of the number is found.

   The first character may be a digit, "+", "-", or "."
   Every following character must be a digit or "." up to anything
   that is not a digit or "." (a second "." terminates reading).

   This function is not called if the first character is NULL, so it is
   not necessary to check that.

   The temporary insertion of a NULL character on the line is to avoid
   making a format string like "%3lf" which the LynxOS compiler cannot
   handle.

   Side effects: See below

   Called by:  rs274ngc_read

   This reads a line of RS274 code from a command string or a file into
   the line array. If the command string is not null, the file is ignored.

   If the end of file is reached, an error is returned as described
   above. The end of the file should not be reached because (a) if the
   file started with a percent line, it must end with a percent line, and
   no more reading of the file should occur after that, and (b) if the
   file did not start with a percent line, it must have a program ending
   command (M2 or M30) in it, and no more reading of the file should
   occur after that.

   All blank space at the end of a line read from a file is removed and
   replaced here with NULL characters.

   This then calls close_and_downcase to downcase and remove tabs and
   spaces from everything on the line that is not part of a comment. Any
   comment is left as is.

   The length is set to zero if any of the following occur:
   1. The line now starts with a slash, but the second character is NULL.
   2. The first character is NULL.
   Otherwise, length is set to the length of the line.

   An input line is blank if the first character is NULL or it consists
   entirely of tabs and spaces and, possibly, a newline before the first
   NULL.

   Block delete is discussed in [NCMS, page 3] but the discussion makes
   no sense. Block delete is handled by having this function return
   RS274NGC_EXECUTE_FINISH if the first character of the
   close_and_downcased line is a slash. When the caller sees this,
   the caller is expected not to call rs274ngc_execute if the switch
   is on, but rather call rs274ngc_read again to overwrite and ignore
   what is read here.

   The value of the length argument is set to the number of characters on
   the reduced line.

   This function restores the parameters from a file, modifying the
   parameters array. Usually parameters is _setup.parameters. The file
   contains lines of the form:

   <variable number> <value>

   e.g.,

   5161 10.456

   The variable numbers must be in increasing order, and certain
   parameters must be included, as given in the _required_parameters
   array. These are the axis offsets, the origin index (5220), and nine
   sets of origin offsets. Any parameter not given a value in the file
   has its value set to zero.
